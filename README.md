# Human Resource Analysis and Employee Attrition Prediction using Python

#### Attrition in business can mean the reduction in staff and employees in a company through normal means, such as retirement and resignation, the loss of customers or clients to old age or growing out of the company's target demographic.

#### Attrition Rate: A common attrition rate definition refers to employee or staff turnover, but in a broader sense, attrition rate is a calculation of the number of individuals or items that vacate or move out of a larger, collective group over a specified time frame. Attrition rate is also commonly referred to as churn rate. 

### Step 1 -Define the Goal

#### The following questions are among the ones every Company suffering with high Employee Attrition Rate would like to be answered:

   #####       1. What proportion of our staff are leaving?
   #####       2. Where is it occurring?
   #####       3. How does Age and Length of Service affect termination?
   #####       4. What, if anything, else contributes to it?
   #####       5. Can we predict future terminations?
   #####       6. If so, how well can we predict?
