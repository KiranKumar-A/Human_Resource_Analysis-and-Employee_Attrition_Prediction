# Human Resource Analysis and Employee Attrition Prediction in Python

#### Attrition in business can mean the reduction in staff and employees in a company through normal means, such as retirement and resignation, the loss of customers or clients to old age or growing out of the company's target demographic.

#### Attrition Rate: A common attrition rate definition refers to employee or staff turnover, but in a broader sense, attrition rate is a calculation of the number of individuals or items that vacate or move out of a larger, collective group over a specified time frame. Attrition rate is also commonly referred to as churn rate.
